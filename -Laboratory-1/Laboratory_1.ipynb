    "OBSERVATION: By using the function zip(), the two lists was put together and convert them together into the string by using the join string method. The word 'at level' was added in-between of the pokemon names and level in the positional argument from the format string method so that when it prints, it will follow the format assigned which is the (\"{} {} {}\".format(party, 'at level', levels). So, the first index from the 'party', will go to the first {} to be followed by the word \"at level\" into the second {} then lastly the first index from the 'levels' list into last {}. Then it will loop again proceeding to the second indexes until it reached the last one on the lists of party and levels"

    "OBSERVATION: A 'pick' variable was firstly defined as a list. After that, the reserves list was sorted out into descending order by using the reverse keyword as one of a parameter of the sort method. It was set to True because the default value of reverse is False. Also, a lambda expression or anonymous function was used as the second parameter of the sort method to set the location of the index that will be accessed from the list of tuple/pokemon with levels that contain 0 and 1 index. Also, the sorting of tuples/pokemon with levels by their 2nd index was achieved because of indication with the lambda expression to access the second index which is in code is \"key=lambda x: x[1]\". Therefore, If the lambda expression was not used, the sort method will sort the list alphabetically based on the 0 index which is the names of pokemon. Lastly, after sorting it, the first 3 elements were added to pick the empty list created and print the pick list to show the three Pok√©mons."
